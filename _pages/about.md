Market power in the US has been rising over the last 40 years. However, the causes remain largely unknown. This paper uses machine learning on regulatory documents to construct a novel dataset on compliance costs to examine the effect of regulations on market power. The dataset is comprehensive and consists of all significant regulations at the 6-digit NAICS level from 1970-2018. We find that regulatory costs have increased by $1 trillion during this period. Moreover, small firms face higher costs than large firms despite attempts from regulators and politicians to limit the burden on small firms. We document that an increase in regulatory costs results in lower (higher) sales, employment, markups, and profitability for small (large) firms. Regulation driven increase in concentration is associated with lower productivity and investment after the late 1990s. We estimate that increased regulations can explain 31-37% of the rise in market power. Finally, we uncover the political economy of rulemaking. While large firms are opposed to regulations in general, they push for the passage of regulations that have an adverse impact on small firms.

Using the negotiation process of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), this paper studies the way regulators form their positions on regulatory issues in the process of international standard-setting and the consequences on the resultant harmonized framework. Leveraging on leaked voting records and corroborating them using machine learning techniques on publicly available speeches, we construct a unique dataset containing the positions of banks and national regulators on the regulatory initiatives of Basel II and III. We document that the probability of a regulator opposing a specific initiative increases by 30% if their domestic national champion opposes the new rule, particularly when the proposed rule disproportionately affects them. We find the effect is driven by regulators who had prior experience of working in large banks - lending support to the private-interest theories of regulation. Meanwhile smaller banks, even when they collectively have a higher share in the domestic market, do not have any impact on regulators’ stand - providing little support to public-interest theories of regulation.  Finally, we show this decision-making process manifests into significant watering down of proposed rules, thereby limiting the potential gains from harmonization of international financial regulation.

We investigate the evolution of gender norms for 160 years in the US. Socioeconomists have posited two fundamental and widely debated theories on the evolution of cultural norms across time. One argues that cultural norms should converge across time as economies become more advanced and integrated, whereas the other states that cultural traits are highly persistent, passed down from generation to generation. These theories remain untested due to a lack of granular and high-frequency data over a longer time period. We develop a novel unsupervised machine learning methodology and apply it to 193 million pages of local newspaper text to produce localised attitudes towards women on four dimensions: career vs family, attitudes towards abortion, attitudes towards feminism/suffrage, and violence against women. We establish novel facts on the evolution of attitudes across time. First, attitudes are less persistent than the existing literature hypothesises. Second, the persistence varies considerably across regions and dimensions. Third, attitudes exhibit cyclical patterns. Fourth, regional variation in attitudes decreases considerably over time and has fallen between 64% to 79%. Fifth, a decrease in transport costs that allows for easier information sharing is associated with a homogenisation of the norms.

**[Machine Unlearning Human Biases: Inclusive Word Embeddings by Excluding Biased Text](https://shikharsingla.com/files/debias_ss.pdf)**<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('debias')">Abstract</a> ]</small>
<div id="debias" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Word embeddings exhibit biases such as racial and gender biases due to the presence of these biases in the training corpus. Usage of these algorithms can increase the stereotypes in various contexts. We present a simple and generalizable approach of detecting the parts of a corpus that affect the bias and show how removing those parts can debias the word embeddings. The approach finds words that link the target words for a group and biased or attribute words (indirect bias). Unlike prior work, our approach a) removes the biases completely, b) removes indirect bias, and c) can be generalized to any type of bias, downstream task or word embedding model. We apply our methodology on Wikipedia and American National Corpus (ANC) for Word2Vec and GloVe models on the racial and gender biases. It is highly accurate in removing the biases without affecting the performance of the models in capturing semantic information.

<!-- **High-Resolution Satellite Imagery, Deep Learning, and Return Predictability**<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('image')">Abstract</a> | Draft Coming Soon ]</small>
<div id="image" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
The literature has shown that satellite imagery can be used to measure economic conditions. This paper extends this approach by applying convolutional neural networks on establishment-level high-resolution satellite images to predict real-time firm-level cash flows. The paper leverages recently available high-resolution satellite images made publicly available by Google and innovations in neural network architecture to extract the relevant features from the images that predict firms’ cash flows.

## Financial Regulation

**[Capital Requirements, Market-Making, and Liquidity](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4250896)**\

<div id="capital" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We employ a proprietary transaction-level dataset in Germany to examine how capital requirements affect the liquidity of corporate bonds. Using the 2011 European Banking Authority capital exercise that mandated certain banks to increase regulatory capital, we find that affected banks reduce their inventory holdings, pre-arrange more trades, and have smaller average trade size. While non-bank affiliated dealers increase their market-making activity, they are unable to bridge this gap - aggregate liquidity declines. Our results are stronger for banks with a higher capital shortfall, for non-investment grade bonds, and for bonds where the affected banks were the dominant market-maker.

<div id="supra" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We exploit the establishment of a supranational supervisor in Europe (the Single Supervisory Mechanism) to learn how the organizational design of supervisory institutions impacts the enforcement of financial regulation. Banks under supranational supervision are required to increase regulatory capital for exposures to the same firm compared to banks under the local supervisor. Local supervisors provide preferential treatment to larger institutes. The central supervisor removes such biases, which results in an overall standardized behavior. While the central supervisor treats banks more equally, we document a loss in information in banks’ risk models associated with central supervision. The tighter supervision of larger banks results
in a shift of particularly risky lending activities to smaller banks. We document lower sales and employment for firms receiving most of their funding from banks that receive a tighter supervisory treatment. Overall, the central supervisor treats banks more equally but has less information about them than the local supervisor.

## Deep Learning

**Human-Centred AI Investor Using Deep Generative Models, Reinforcement Learning and Prospect Theory**<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('hai')">Abstract</a> ]</small>
<div id="hai" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Artificial intelligence (AI) driven personalised portfolio management and indexes have not become as widely adopted as some scholars and industry practitioners have predicted. Two reasons have been proposed for the lack of adoption. First, the lack of Artificial Humanity or Human-Centred AI, i.e., the absence of an AI-driven asset manager that maximises value under more psychologically realistic frameworks, such as prospect theory (PT), instead of just focusing on the mean-variance optimisation. Second, most current AI methods involve supervised machine-learning techniques that use the actual portfolios to learn trading behaviour which contain human biases such as overconfidence and overreaction, leading to lower performance by humans and, thus, AI investors. I combine deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with deep generative models (DGMs) to overcome these two shortcomings. The proposed framework helps overcome three key methodological challenges. First, portfolio optimisation under non-concave functions such as PT is an unsolved problem, but DRL can handle complicated reward functions. Second, DRL learns to predict returns through a trial-and-error search, avoiding human biases. Third, PT investor cares about the entire probability distribution of future stock returns, which can be simulated using DGM as they are fundamentally probabilistic. My paper suggests against the weak efficient market hypothesis and provides a methodology to construct a Human-Centred AI asset manager that aligns with human preferences while avoiding human biases.

**Economic Nowcasting Using Deep Generative Models**<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('nowcast')">Abstract</a> | Draft Coming Soon ]</small>
<div id="nowcast" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Economic nowcasting aims to provide predictions that i) are consistent across spatial and temporal dimensions, ii) account for uncertainty and can be verified probabilistically, and iii) perform well on events that are rarer but critical. These characteristics are missing in commonly used deterministic nowcasting methods. Thus these models produce forecasts with higher errors at higher lead times and may not include small-scale yet important patterns. This paper overcomes these challenges by developing a novel deep generative model (DGM). The model is driven by two loss functions defined by spatial and temporal discriminators and a regularisation term. These terms guide parameter adjustment by comparing real observations with model-generated data. The first loss function ensures spatial consistency and discourages errors at higher lead times, whereas the second imposes temporal consistency and penalises jumpy predictions. The regularisation term further improves the accuracy by penalising deviations at the local level. The model architecture is based on stacked Convolutional Gated Recurrent (ConvGRU) Units.
